# Default Plaid-Pad Layout

This is the default layout for the plaid pad. 
The upper left (7) and right (/) switch, can be replaced by a rotary encoder.
Encoders with built-in switch are supported and map to the original keys (7) and (/).

Encoder E1 performs a tap on `KC_F21` and `KC_F22` and
encoder E2 performs a tap on `KC_F23` and `KC_F24`.

*The F21-F24 keys are intended to be customized via [Karabiner-Elements (OSX)](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements), or [AutoHotkey](https://github.com/Lexikos/AutoHotkey_L) (WIN)*

Encoder E3 performs a tap on "Right Arrow" (`KC_RIGHT`) and "Left Arrow" (`KC_LEFT`)  when rotated clockwise and counter-clockwise in the respective direction for each step of the encoder. 

Encoder E4 performs a tap on "Up Arrow" (`KC_UP`) and "Down Arrow" (`KC_DOWN`) when rotated clockwise and counter-clockwise in the respective direction for each step of the encoder.
